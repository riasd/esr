<p> lhamdulillah,All praise be to Allah  the almighty, for  His opened and  concealed bounties, 
which bestows at all times. may the peace  and blessings  of Allah be upon the final messenger, his f
amily and companions and all those who strive in the path of Allah till the day of judgement, as well 
as their followers who inherited their knowledge for indeed the scholars(ulama) are the heirs of the 
prophets! May Allah, the almighty bless them all and their followers. </p>
<p>Dear distinguished fathers, mothers and my respected brothers and sisters the theme of t
his year's edition of our news bulletin was born out of the fact that itâ€™s our second edition of publication and 
I pray that Almighty Allah makes this continuous work an act of  ibadah , Ameen. And also the theme of our 
USRAH WEEK (Let's make a change), was born out of the fact that having known that sins prevailed over t
he land and also different misconceptions have been placed on Islam and also known that its time to do good 
and turn to ALMIGHTY ALLAH in everything we do (theme of the last usrah week), we ought to make a change 
obviously and stop playing ignorant to the things we see happening around us. We wish that this second news bulletin 
an rekindle the heart of  its readers on the truism of peace which Islam preaches and also remind ourselves about our duties to
Almighty Allah, love for the beloved prophet (SAW), and also know the fact the change has to be made and avoid been 
ignorant to sins we commit. </p>
